## Blog Post: What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com?

As part of this project, I wrote a blog post explaining in detail what happens when you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press **Enter**.  

The article covers the entire journey, including:
- DNS request  
- TCP/IP  
- Firewall  
- HTTPS/SSL  
- Load balancer  
- Web server  
- Application server  
- Database
